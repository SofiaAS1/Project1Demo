<p> 
Team project in which we:
• Cleaned & concatenated 2017-2020 Haas Avocado Board data from 4 CSV files to one pandas data frame to review export volumes from major importers to the US in net total and per each year analyzed.
• Cleaned & analyzed 2015-2020 Haas Avocado Board data taken from a separate Kaggle project to answer several questions surrounding Haas avocado consumption including time of year vs sales & price, popularity of Haas avocados within the US by region, packaging type of avocados vs sales, and prices and sales of conventional Haas avocados vs organic.
• Advised on trends, reported the statistical significance of results (Chi Squared Test), and presented the analysis of processed data with applicable visualizations.
• Used: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), Jupyter Lab, Microsoft Powerpoint.
